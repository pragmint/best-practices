# Work As a Team to Solve Problems

Organizations are obsessed with metrics, and for good reason. However that mentality can create situations where an individual's performance is measured by easily gamified metrics like velocity or lines of code written. This also creates incentives against collaboration.

Teams should be incentivized to solve problems together. That way, meaningful collaboration can take place. This also creates the space for team members to help each other. This support system is crucial to a team's long-term success.
