# Work As a Team to Solve Problems

Organizations are obsessed with metrics, and for good reason. However that mentality can create situations where an individual's performance is measured by easily gamified metrics like velocity or lines of code written. This also creates incentives against collaboration.

Teams should be incentivized to solve problems together. That way, meaningful collaboration can take place. This also creates the space for team members to help each other. This support system is crucial to a team's long-term success.

### Mentoring

Being a mentor can be as simple as giving time to someone who is in need of some guidance. It is also possible to put formalized Mentorship Programs together for your organization or community. Providing mentorship can strengthen relationships, create unique opportunities for introspection, build confidence, feel rewarding, and so much more.

Building a formalized Apprenticeship / Mentorship Program is a reliable way to create consistency amongst teams within an organization. Great programs give apprentices the space to fail and subsequently learn from those failures. They also push apprentices just past the edges of their comfort zones such that meaningful experimentation can take place. Great apprentices approach apprenticeship programs with an open mind and an eagerness to learn as much as possible.
