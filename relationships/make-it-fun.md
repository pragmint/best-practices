# Make it Fun

Fun should be an important aspect of any endeavor we chose to take on. Having fun with others can strengthen relationships. It can also reduce stress, which leads to better decision making and a healthier life. If something is fun, we're more likely to do it well.

While we can find certain activities fun, it is important to note that fun can be influenced by our state of mind as well. In other words, our mindset affects the amount of fun we experience. There are some things we can do that help us get into that state of mind which are outlined in the resources section below.

## Resources

### Mixed Teams

Mixed teams are best b/c you get the experience and the excitement. Having fun is paramount. If your team is mentoring an inexperienced developer, that can be fun. Also, whenever someone is learning, they get excited. Excitement is infectious.

Conventional wisdom says that we should only hire coding "rockstars", "ninjas", or "10x developers." This way, fewer mistakes get made and stuff gets done faster. So what redeeming qualities do more junior team members bring to the table? Juniors bring excitement, curiosity, willingness, and so much more. Having someone on the team with that attitude is infectious. Your more senior developers are likely to take on those attitudes as well. So you can find yourself in a 1+1=3 sort of situation by creating mixed teams.
