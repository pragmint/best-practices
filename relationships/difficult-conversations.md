# Don't Shy Away From Difficult Conversations

Conversations can be difficult for a number of reasons, but oftentimes the difficulty is around navigating the emotions of the participants of a conversation. Fear of negative emotional reactions drives aversion to hosting a difficult conversation. Understanding how to create psychological safety can reduce the anxiety levels of participants, and create a platform to have important and otherwise difficult conversations.

### Crucial Conversations

A conversation is crucial if the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong. These sort of conversations are important to have tactfully soon after a problem or tension is uncovered. If a conversation of this magnitude is avoided, it will boil over and have potentially costly side-effects. When having a crucial conversation, it's important to remain objective and understand what your core goals of the conversation are. If handled correctly, crucial conversations can strengthen relationships.
