# [Loosely Coupled Teams](https://dora.dev/capabilities/loosely-coupled-teams/)

## Key Points

* Teams can make large-scale changes to the design of their systems without the permission of somebody outside the team or depending on other teams.
* Teams are able to complete work without needing fine-grained communication and coordination with people outside the team.
* Teams deploy and release their product or service on demand, independently of the services it depends on or of other services that depend on it.
* Teams do most of their testing on demand, without requiring an integrated test environment.
* Teams can deploy during normal business hours with negligible downtime.

* Use the proper architectural archetypes according to evolutionary organization needs. Monolithic -> Microservices
