# [Version Control](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/version-control/)

Version control allows teams to revert changes back to a working state. When this is fast an easy to accomplish, teams can move forward with less fear of breaking the system. Technologies like Git and SVN have made version control for code popular. However, this DORA Capability applies all the same to configuration, data, infrastructure, and documentation. Furthermore, version control is foundational for enabling automation, ensuring disaster recovery, and facilitating continuous integration.

## Nuance

### Branching Complexity

While branching strategies could help you organize incremental work, overly complex branching structures can lead to confusion. Striking a balance between simplicity and effectiveness is key.

### Misconception: "It Only Tracks Code"

Version control goes beyond tracking lines of code; it encompasses documentation, configurations, and other project artifacts, this allows you to keep in sync all artifacts for an specific version/release.

### Misconception: "It's Only About Rollbacks"

While rollbacks are a valuable aspect, version control is equally about enabling collaboration, facilitating code reviews, and supporting continuous integration. Seeing it solely as a safety net for mistakes overlooks its role in enhancing the entire development lifecycle.

### Consideration: Learning Curve

Introducing version control may have a learning curve, especially for teams new to the concept. Providing adequate training and support during the transition is essential to avoid frustration and ensure a smooth adaptation.

### Consideration: Regular Maintenance

Neglecting regular maintenance of version control systems can lead to inefficiencies. Cleaning up obsolete branches, ensuring proper documentation, and periodically optimizing repositories contribute to a healthier version control environment.

### Consideration: Striking a Balance

Striking a balance between maintaining a well-organized version control system and focusing on actual development work is crucial for a productive workflow.

## Introspective Questions

### Do you have a clear history?
   Does your version control strategy provide a clear view into the changes made over time, fostering predictability and informed decision-making?

### Are Your Code Collaborations Like a Well-Choreographed Dance?
   Is your version control helping or hindering smooth collaboration? Are you utilizing branching and merging effectively to avoid stepping on each other's toes during code changes?

### What's the Story Your Code Tells?
   Think about the narrative your codebase tells. Does your version control capture the evolution of your project comprehensively? Can someone join your team and easily follow the storyline of your code's development?

### How Fast Can You Bounce Back from Code Hiccups?
   Consider how quickly your team can recover from mistakes or unexpected issues. Does your version control provide a safety net for rapid rollbacks and quick resolutions, or are you left grappling with prolonged downtimes?

### Do you have conflicts often?
   Imagine your codebase as a musical composition. Is your version control orchestrating a harmonious collaboration among developers, or is it contributing to a cacophony of conflicting changes and dissonance?

### Are You Building a Code Time Capsule or a Living Document?
   Think about how your codebase will be perceived in the future. Is your version control creating a time capsule that captures the essence of each development phase, or is it merely a static document lacking the vibrancy of a living, evolving project?

## Supporting Practices

### [Automate Database Migrations](/practices/automate-database-migrations.md)
**Relationship:** Improves  
Implementing Automatic Database Migrations enhances the effectiveness of the Version Control capability by ensuring database schema changes are consistently versioned and managed alongside application code. This practice fosters an environment where code and database changes are integrated, tested, and deployed in a unified manner, leading to more reliable and streamlined development workflows. It directly contributes to the core objectives of version control by adding a layer of automation and traceability to database evolution.

### [Avoid Storing Config in Version Control](/practices/avoid-storing-config-in-version-control.md)
**Relationship:** Improves    
This practice improves Version Control by segregating application code from operational configurations. It minimizes risks associated with data exposure and declutters repositories, focusing version control efforts on code changes. This method enhances security and deployment processes, reinforcing the core principles of effective version control management

### [Clean Git History](/practices/clean-git-history.md)
**Relationship:** Improves  
Maintaining a Clean Git History enhances the Version Control capability by ensuring a clear, navigable, and meaningful project history. This practice facilitates better understanding, collaboration, and troubleshooting by making the revision history easier to follow. It directly supports the objectives of effective version control, contributing to more efficient and reliable software development processes.

### [Check Documentation Consistency](/practices/check-documentation-consistency.md)
**Relationship:** Enables  
Implementing Check Documentation Consistency enables the Version Control capability by ensuring that all documentation is kept up-to-date and consistent with the codebase it describes. This practice facilitates better alignment between documentation and software development, ensuring that changes in code are accurately reflected in the documentation, thereby enhancing the overall quality and reliability of both the codebase and the supporting documents.

### [Automate Infrastructure Management](/practices/automate-infrastructure-management.md)

**Relationship:** Improves   
Infrastructure as Code enhances the Version Control capability by applying its principles to infrastructure management. This practice ensures that infrastructure provisioning and configuration are as reproducible and transparent as application code changes, fostering better collaboration and consistency across development and operations teams.

### [Version Dependencies](/practices/version-dependencies.md)
**Relationship:** Improves  
Version Dependencies complement the Version Control capability by ensuring dependencies are managed with the same diligence as source code. This practice enhances reproducibility, traceability, and consistency in software builds, aligning with the core principles of effective version control for comprehensive software development management.

### [Working in Small Increments](/practices/working-in-small-increments.md)
**Relationship:** Improves  
Working in Small Increments improves the Version Control capability by facilitating more manageable, frequent, and understandable commits. This practice enhances the traceability and reversibility of changes, making it easier to identify and address issues quickly, thereby improving the overall efficiency and reliability of the development process.
