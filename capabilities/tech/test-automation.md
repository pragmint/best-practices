# [Test Automation](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/test-automation/)

Test automation is essential for building quality into software by providing fast feedback throughout the software delivery lifecycle.
It addresses the inefficiencies of manual testing, such as time consumption, unreliability, and delayed feedback.
Automated testing should be integrated continuously, involving various types of tests, such as unit and acceptance tests, to ensure functionality and prevent regression errors.

Effective test automation requires collaboration between testers and developers, continuous improvement of test suites, and maintaining a balanced ratio of unit and acceptance tests.
This approach software quality and stability and also reduces team burnout and deployment challenges.
