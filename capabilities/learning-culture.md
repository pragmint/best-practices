# [Learning Culture](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/cultural/learning-culture/)

Culture is defined by the behaviors a group of people regularly exhibit.
It's not some aspirational statement that someone in marketing or HR came up with.
Having a culture that prioritizes learning is core to a team's ability to improve.
As such, this capability is a good place to start if you're looking to improve your teams' ability to deliver impactful results.

## Nuance

### Importance of Leadership

A learning culture can only be fostered if there is support from leadership.
If leaders aren't creating the space and advocating for learning, the team's focus will shift to execution.
If a team is only ever focused on execution, the team's performance isn't likely to improve over time.

## Introspective Questions

- Does your organization view learning as an investment necessary for growth?
- Is learning seen as a necessary burden, undertaken only grudgingly?
- Is learning completely avoided?

## Supporting Practices

### [Lead A Demonstration](/practices/lead-a-demonstration.md)

Leading a demonstration is an excellent way to engage an audience by live coding, showcasing customer feedback, or presenting on a specific topic. Demonstrations can vary in length, from brief lightning talks to more extended sessions, and can be conducted as one-off events or as part of a regular series. This format is particularly effective for introducing new topics or ideas, as it allows the presenter to provide a clear and focused explanation. Including a Q&A session at the end or during the demonstration can enhance understanding and provide immediate clarification. However, this approach is less effective for spurring in-depth discussions, as the primary focus is on delivering content rather than fostering interactive dialogue.

### [Run Pair Programming Sessions](/practices/run-pair-programming-sessions.md)

Run Pair Programming Sessions is a practice that can significantly foster a learning culture within an organization by promoting continuous knowledge sharing and collaboration. In these sessions, two developers work together at a single workstation, enabling the exchange of skills, techniques, and best practices in real-time. This collaborative environment accelerates the onboarding process for new team members and also helps experienced developers refine their skills through peer review and immediate feedback.

### [Lead Workshops](/practices/lead-workshops.md)

Leading workshops is an excellent method for providing participants with hands-on experience, allowing them to actively engage with the material. Workshops are particularly effective in breaking down preconceived notions, as they offer a practical approach to learning and problem-solving. However, workshops are not ideal for introducing new topics or ideas. Participants may struggle if they lack foundational understanding, which can hinder their ability to fully benefit from the hands-on experience. To ensure success, it's important to establish a solid groundwork before diving into more complex workshop activities.

### [Host A Roundtable Discussion](/practices/host-a-roundtable-discussion.md)

Hosting a roundtable discussion involves coming prepared with a few key talking points, then allowing the conversation to evolve organically. A good host ensures that the discussion remains productive while limiting their interventions, welcoming productive tangents that can lead to deeper insights. This format is particularly effective when the topic is already somewhat understood by the participants, as it encourages a deeper understanding through collaborative dialogue and diverse perspectives. Roundtable discussions are excellent for spurring meaningful conversations and uncovering new angles on familiar topics.

### [Start A Book Club](/practices/start-a-book-club.md)

Starting a book club can encompass a variety of materials, including books, whitepapers, blogs, articles, and podcasts. This practice is excellent for encouraging experienced practitioners to consider new ideas and perspectives. By engaging with diverse content and participating in thoughtful discussions, members can expand their knowledge and challenge their existing viewpoints. Book clubs provide a structured yet flexible environment for continuous learning and professional growth. However, if there is a lot of content to go through, this burden can create drop-off for less invested parties. This needs to be managed.

### [Host A Viewing Party](/practices/host-a-viewing-party.md)

Hosting a viewing party is a great way to engage a group with conference talks, podcasts, or short videos. As you go through the content together, you can pause at key points or when questions arise to facilitate discussion. This approach is particularly effective for getting experienced practitioners to consider new ideas and perspectives, as it combines the informative nature of the content with the collaborative benefits of group discussion. By allowing time for conversation and reflection, viewing parties can enhance understanding and inspire innovative thinking.

### [Do A Spike](/practices/do-a-spike.md)

Also referred to as building a proof-of-concept (POC), this practice involves setting a short period of time aside in order to get some hands on experience building a solution as a means to reduce uncertainty. Spikes tend to last a couple of hours or days (at the most). They're a great way to try out a new practice, process, or tool. Given a spike's short duration, it's helpful to have an experienced member of the team lead these efforts to avoid teams from getting stuck for prolonged periods of time.

### [Host A Retrospective](/practices/host-a-retrospective.md)

Hosting a retrospective is a vital tool for continuous improvement within a team or organization. These sessions can be routine or focused on a specific event, such as a postmortem. The key to a successful retrospective is to walk away with clear action items while maintaining a blameless environment. It's important to vary the format to keep it fresh and prevent it from becoming a value-less ceremony. Recognize that constraints and pain points are unavoidable; the goal is not to eliminate them entirely but to reduce their frequency or impact. Be mindful of the trade-offs when introducing new controls, ensuring they donâ€™t become excessive. Retrospectives are excellent for fine-tuning processes and addressing immediate issues, though they are less effective for sparking visionary changes.

### [Talk Directly With Users](/practices/talk-directly-with-users.md)

Talking directly with users is an invaluable practice for gaining insights and understanding their needs and challenges. This can be achieved through various methods such as fielding customer support calls, hosting developer office hours, or running focus groups. Engaging with users in these ways helps to gather real-world feedback, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement. By maintaining direct communication, you can ensure that your product or service aligns closely with user expectations and fosters a stronger connection between your team and your user base.

### [Dogfood Your Systems](/practices/dogfood-your-systems.md)

Dogfooding your systems involves having your teams use the same products or systems that your users do, allowing them to experience the same pain points firsthand. This practice helps build empathy with users, identify issues early, and drive improvements based on direct user experience. By regularly using your own systems, your team can gain valuable insights and ensure that the product meets the highest standards of usability and performance.

### [Start A Community Of Practice](/practices/start-a-community-of-practice.md)

Starting a community of practice provides a dedicated space where a variety of practices can be performed. This collaborative environment fosters continuous learning, sharing of best practices, and collective problem-solving. By bringing together practitioners with shared interests, a community of practice can drive innovation, enhance skills, and promote a culture of continuous improvement. It serves as a flexible platform for implementing various practices and exploring new ideas within the group.

### [Use SPIN To Unearth Problems and Solutions](/practices/use-spin-to-unearth-problems-and-solutions.md)

50% of solving a problem is to first know it exists. Use SPIN To Unearth Problems and Solutions provides a clear framework for uncovering problems and solutions. An organization equipped with SPIN techniques will be able to uncover problems and solutions at higher rates, allowing teams to learn from past decisions and continuously improve.
