# [Documentation Quality](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/process/documentation-quality/)

Documentation quality refers to the accuracy, completeness, and accessibility of internal documentation, enabling teams to effectively collaborate, make informed decisions, and deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably. By investing in documentation quality, developers can reduce errors, improve productivity, and enhance overall performance.

## Nuance

### Importance of Clear and Findable Documentation

Clear and findable documentation is essential for effective knowledge sharing and collaboration within teams. Without it, teams may struggle to understand existing systems, leading to a decrease in development speed and reliability.

### Reliability and Maintenance of Documentation

Documentation must be actively maintained and updated to ensure it remains relevant and accurate. This requires a deliberate effort to review and refine documentation regularly. Sometimes misleading documentation can be worse than missing documentation.

## Assessment

To assess how mature your team or organization is in this capability, answer the question below.

Don't worry if the description doesn't exactly match your situation. The descriptions are meant as examples of situations that would qualify for the associated score. Generally, score yourself a 1 if this capability is completely missing from your team, a 2 if there is a lot of room for improvement, a 3 if there is some room for improvement, and a 4 if your team is exemplary in this capability.

1. **Minimal:** The technical documentation is often outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, making it difficult to rely on when working with the services or applications. It's hard to find what is needed, and others are often asked for help.
2. **Basic:** The technical documentation is somewhat reliable, but it's not always easy to find what is needed. Updates are sporadic, and multiple sources must be dug through to get the required information. In times of crisis, the documentation might be glanced at, but it's not always trusted.
3. **Good:** The technical documentation is generally reliable, and what is needed can usually be found with some effort. Updates are made regularly, but not always immediately. The documentation is used to help troubleshoot issues, but clarification from others might still be needed.
4. **Excellent:** The technical documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date. What is needed can easily be found, and the documentation is relied on heavily when working with the services or applications. When issues arise, the documentation is confidently reached for to help troubleshoot and resolve problems.

## Supporting Practices

### [Use Documentation Auto-Generation Tooling](/practices/use-documentation-auto-generation-tooling.md)

Automate the creation of documentation using tools that generate comprehensive and up-to-date documentation directly from the source code or configuration files. This practice ensures that documentation stays in sync with the codebase, reducing the manual effort required to maintain it, and minimizes the risk of outdated or incomplete information. Tools like [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api) create executable documentation, while tools like [RepoAgent](https://github.com/OpenBMB/RepoAgent) use LLMs to keep the documentation in sync as the codebase changes.

### [Implement A Documentation Search Engine](/practices/implement-a-documentation-search-engine.md)

Implementing a documentation search engine enables team members to quickly find relevant documentation, reducing the time spent searching for information and increasing productivity.

### [Schedule Regular Documentation Audits](/practices/schedule-regular-documentation-audits.md)

Scheduling regular documentation audits ensures that documentation remains up-to-date, comprehensive, and accurate. As systems and processes evolve, it's important to spend some time auditing our existing documentation to ensure they're accurate.

## Related Capabilities

### [Continuous Integration](/capabilities/continuous-integration.md)

High-quality documentation is essential for effective continuous integration, as it enables teams to understand the existing systems and make informed decisions about changes.

### [Learning Culture](/capabilities/learning-culture.md)

A culture of learning and knowledge sharing relies heavily on high-quality documentation, which enables teams to learn from each other and build on existing knowledge.

### [Code Maintainability](/capabilities/code-maintainability.md)

Good documentation is critical for maintaining code quality, as it helps developers understand the codebase and make informed decisions about changes.
