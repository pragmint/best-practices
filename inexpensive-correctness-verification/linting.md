# Linting

A linter is a tool that scans (and sometimes alters) a codebase in order to find bugs, security vulnerabilities, code formatting issues, software complexity, etc. Leveraging these tools can create consistency and find bugs that humans might otherwise miss.

### Vulnerability Scanning

Every day, new security vulnerabilities are found. In order to keep up with the more well known vulnerabilities, it's helpful to (1) understand a bit about potential attack vectors and (2) leverage a vulnerability scanning tool to ensure your software & its dependencies are free of known security vulnerabilities.
