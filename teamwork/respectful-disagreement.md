### Crucial Conversations

A conversation is crucial if the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong. These sort of conversations are important to have tactfully soon after a problem or tension is uncovered. If a conversation of this magnitude is avoided, it will boil over and have potentially costly side-effects. When having a crucial conversation, it's important to remain objective and understand what your core goals of the conversation are. If handled correctly, crucial conversations can strengthen relationships.
