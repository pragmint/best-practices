# Create Clarity

Every team member comes in with a different set of expectations and norms. This makes it really easy for incorrect assumptions to be made. Where practical, these assumptions should be made known.

### Document "Norm-ed" Values and Behaviors

What is the "right" thing to do? This is a question that people ask themselves every day. Part of that decision making is informed by each individual's experiences and world-view. However, a significant part of that decision making is also informed by what the expectations are of the organization or team that individual is apart of. Unless of course those expectations aren't made clear.

A company's culture is made up of the behaviors that each team member exhibits. So if you want to influence the culture of a team or organization, it is beneficial to inspect the behaviors and attempt to influence them by documenting expectations.

### Understand the Core Problems and Systems

Good decision making is rooted in a deep understanding of the surrounding context. When making architectural decisions, it's helpful to understand what requirements are likely to remain constant and which ones are likely to evolve. This is just as true at the system level as it is at the code level. Every member of the development team should be armed with a strong understanding of the core set of problems that the software is attempting to solve for.

#### Domain Driven Design

Part of solving for the core problems involves using a consistent vocabulary that mirrors the domain of the problem being solved. The act of naming can actually clue you in to good architectural directions as well. That's where the discipline of Domain-Driven Design can be useful.

### User Stories

User stories help software development teams understand what work they need to complete, in a way that is optimized for getting small changes deployed to production as quickly as possible. This concept was introduced as a counter pressure to organizations that waste a lot of time building large, detailed sets of requirements upfront. However, the practice of User Stories can also be useful for organizations that don't put much effort into creating a shared understanding amongst the entire team.

### Don't Just Talk About Progress, Show it in Action

Even if a chunk of work isn't user facing, there should be an attempt to demo the new changes. This invites feedback and makes it crystal clear to the whole team what specific decisions have been made. This creates a clear shared context, which will benefit the entire team going forward.

### Create an Honest and Clear Understanding of Progress Amongst Stakeholders

The traditional act of estimating isn't something we necessarily advocate for. Rather we advocate for the outcome of having stakeholders that understand where the team is at in the process of accomplishing a goal. This can sometimes mean estimating remaining work. However (especially in more R&D type of environments) it isn't always clear what work remains to be done, which makes this especially difficult. Some people advocate for a complexity based estimates, some time-based estimates, others advocate for not estimating at all. It is helpful to understand the various perspectives as we don't believe there to be a one-size fits all answer for this problem. We instead advocate for a solid understanding of the various approaches, such that the right tool can be brought out for a given team or organization.
