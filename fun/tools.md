# Invest in Your Tools

Great developer tooling enables organizations to better leverage their technology investment. A great developer tool will automate repetitive tasks and allow team members to focus more on creative problem solving. This is a virtuous cycle; the more value your tools bring, the more value your team can create, the more fun your team is having, and the more engaged your team is. The opposite is true when your tools are unreliable and/or are bottlenecks to making progress.

Every time a dev tool fails, time is wasted. That time is expensive, but it also takes away from the joy of building software. That loss of joy is hard to measure in isolation, but it can negatively affect developer effectiveness, employee turnover, and the culture. Tools should be optimized across the entire software delivery lifecycle in order to get the most out of an organization's tech investment.
