# Be Curious

Curiosity can disarm feelings of frustration, spur learning, solve technical issues, and so much more. While curiosity alone doesn't create value (focused action does), it often sets individuals and organizations up for greater future value. There is such a thing as getting carried away (see [rabbit holes](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/rabbit-hole/)), so curiosity has be be balanced with execution. However, many organizations place far too much of an emphasis on execution to their detriment.

An example of an out of balance focus on execution over curiosity is how many developers tend to not read a tool/technology's documentation. Instead they spin their wheels trying to get a piece of functionality out the door. All too often developers look for hyper-contextual answers to their problems instead of following their curiosity towards a better foundational understanding of the tools/technologies they're working with.
