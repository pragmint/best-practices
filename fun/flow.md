# Optimize for Flow

Flow has two meanings and both of them support having fun. The first meaning is a state of mind where individuals are fully absorbed into the task they're performing. They get in the zone and their mind becomes less distracted and busy. The other meaning is about how work progresses through a system. Optimizing for this sort of flow means less stopping/starting and context switching.

### Flow State of Mind

This can be a difficult attribute to manage for when a lot of our collaboration tools are designed to get someone else's attention. Take any chat application for example. If you have that application running in the background, you typically get notifications whenever someone sends you a message. This can be a positive thing for the organization, because you're shortening a potentially important feedback loop (by responding to a message). However, it comes at the cost of your focus, which may take a while to fully reclaim. The recommendation isn't to uninstall all chat applications. Rather, use the more advanced functionality to set a status and/or mute notifications during regularly scheduled times when you're trying to get into a flow state of mind.

### Flow of Work

There is a lot of value in getting things done quickly. By optimizing for flow of work, you're looking at the entire software delivery lifecycle and trying to eliminate constraints/bottlenecks. This creates faster flow. In doing so, you're likely also limiting Work in Progress (WIP), avoiding context switching, pushing through our around external blockers, etc.
