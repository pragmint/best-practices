# Invest in Your Relationships

Any meaningful project will have bumps in the road. The best way to navigate through those issues is through close collaboration. That close collaboration only works if all parties are able to communicate honestly, openly, and frequently. Doing so requires a strong foundation of trust. It's better to proactively build that strong foundation from the get-go because once you need it, it's often too late to start building it. In the [respectful disagreement section](https://github.com/pragmint/best-practices/blob/main/teamwork/respectful-disagreement.md), it goes into trust, psychological safety, etc which is very much related to this topic. We decided to break this section out to focus on the importance of proactively building those relationships such that you have relationship capital to spend when you need it down the road.

So how should you go about investing in your relationships? Put simply: talk less, listen more, be genuine, and be patient. Many small contributions over a long period of time are better than few big ones over a short period of time.
