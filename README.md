# Best Practices

This repo is a curated collection of concepts and resources that outlines what Pragmint's view of best practices are when building software. Because best practices are often referenced as a nebulous concept, we wanted to break it down more specifically, so that (1) people know how we approach building software and (2) as a community we can learn from each other about what it means to build world class software. We've organized our thoughts into both high level strategies and low level tactics.
