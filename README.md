# Best Practices

This repo is a curated collection of concepts and resources that outlines what Pragmint's view of best practices are when building software. Because best practices are often referenced as a nebulous concept, we wanted to break it down more specifically, so that (1) people know how we approach building software and (2) as a community we can learn from each other about what it means to build world class software. We've organized our thoughts into high level [strategies](https://github.com/pragmint/best-practices#strategies). Each strategy links to a page that further details the strategy and lists related low level tactics that are in support of the strategy.

## Contributing

We chose to make this a git repository so that the community could challenge our thinking. If you have new ideas or wanted to challenge our thinking, we would appreciate you creating a new [issue](https://github.com/pragmint/best-practices/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/pragmint/best-practices/pulls).
