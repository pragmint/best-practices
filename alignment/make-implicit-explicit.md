# Make the Implicit Explicit Where Practical

Every team member comes in with a different set of expectations and norms. This makes it really easy for incorrect assumptions to be made. Where practical, these assumptions should be made known.

### User Stories

User stories help software development teams understand what work they need to complete, in a way that is optimized for getting small changes deployed to production as quickly as possible. This concept was introduced as a counter pressure to organizations that waste a lot of time building large, detailed sets of requirements upfront. However the practice of User Stories can also be useful for organizations that don't put much effort into creating a shared understanding amongst the entire team.

### Document "Norm-ed" Values and Behaviors

What is the "right" thing to do? This is a question that people ask themselves every day. Part of that decision making is informed by each individual's experiences and world-view. However a significant part of that decision making is also informed by what the expectations are of the organization or team that individual is apart of. Unless of course those expectations aren't made clear.

A company's culture is made up of the behaviors that each team member exhibits. So if you want to influence the culture of a team or organization, it is beneficial to inspect the behaviors and attempt to influence them by documenting expectations.
