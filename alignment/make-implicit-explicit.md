# Make the Implicit Explicit Where Practical

Every team member comes in with a different set of expectations and norms. This makes it really easy for incorrect assumptions to be made. Where practical, these assumptions should be made known.

### User Stories

User stories help developers understand what work they need to complete. All too often, little effort goes into creating user stories or tickets. Sometimes the requirements are documented with a single sentence fragment. This is lazy and creates a lot of room for costly misinterpretation.

### Document "Norm-ed" Values and Behaviors

What is the "right" thing to do? This is a question that people ask themselves every day. Part of that decision making is informed by each individual's experiences and world-view. However a significant part of that decision making is also informed by what the expectations are of the organization or team that individual is apart of. Unless of course those expectations aren't made clear.
