# Create an Honest and Clear Understanding of Progress Amongst Stakeholders

This strategy is potentially misleading because the traditional act of estimating isn't something we necessarily advocate for. Rather we advocate for the outcome of having stakeholders that understand where the team is at in the process of accomplishing a goal. This can sometimes mean estimating remaining work. However (especially in more R&D type of environments) it isn't always clear what work remains to be done, which makes this especially difficult. Some advocate for a complexity based estimates, some time based estimates, others advocate for not estimating at all. It is helpful to understand the various perspectives as we don't believe there to be a one-size fits all answer for this problem. We instead advocate for a solid understanding of the various approaches, such that the right tool can be brought out for a given team or organization.
