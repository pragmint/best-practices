# Follow Functional Core, Imperative Shell

Functional Core, Imperative Shell is a software design principle that advocates for dividing code into two layers: a functional core and an imperative shell.
The functional core houses the critical logic of the application, written in a pure, side-effect-free manner following functional programming principles.
This core is highly testable, maintainable, and predictable.
The imperative shell handles interactions with the external world, employing imperative programming for tasks like I/O operations and user interfaces.
This separation of concerns enhances modularity, clarity, and flexibility in software development, enabling easier maintenance and evolution of complex systems.
