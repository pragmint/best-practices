# Implement Continuous Integration Pipeline

* Define what is CI
* Benefits
    * Faster detection and resolution of bugs
    * Improves code quality and reliability
    * Enhanced team collaboration and communication
    * Continuous feedback and visibility
    * Reduced integration problems
* Components
    * Code Repository
    * Automated Build System
    * Testing framework
    * Integration server
    * Notification system
* Commit must be small and frequent
* Maintain a clean and stable main branch
* Automate as much as possible (builds, tests, deployments)
