# Implement Continuous Integration Pipeline

Implementing a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline greatly enhances code quality and development efficiency. CI involves frequently integrating small code changes into the main branch, followed by automated builds, unit tests, linters, static code analysis, and security checks to ensure code stability. This approach differs from Continuous Deployment (CD), which focuses on automatically deploying code, handling migrations, and performing higher-level tests.

A CI pipeline provides faster feedback on code changes, allowing for quick bug detection and resolution. It improves code quality, reduces merge conflicts, and helps maintain a clean, stable main branch. Developers should commit small and frequent changes and automate as many processes as possible, including builds, tests, and linters, to maintain these advantages.

For larger codebases with longer build times, optimizing the CI pipeline is important. Efficiently managing dependencies and incorporating security checks and static code analysis help maintain coding standards and secure the code from vulnerabilities. A well-implemented CI pipeline leads to higher quality software and more efficient development processes.

* Do some research to define clearly de difference between CI and CD
* Read CD and CI Dora capabilities

* Define what is CI
    * Explain difference between CI and CD
        * CI
            * Is a process, constantly integration in small changes
            * Build
            * Run Unit Tests
            * Run Linters and Static Code Analysis
            * Security Checks
        * CD
            * Deployment
            * Migration
            * Higher level Tests
* Benefits
    * Faster feedback/detection and resolution of bugs
    * Improves code quality and reliability
    * Reduced merge problems
* Commit must be small and frequent
* Maintain a clean and stable main branch
* Automate as much as possible (builds, tests, linter)
* Managing dependencies in a CI pipeline
    * Repository level dependencies
        * Libraries
    * External dependencies are CD
