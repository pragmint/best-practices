# Implement TDD

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.
This approach provides numerous benefits, including enhanced code quality, improved design and architecture, early bug detection, increased developer confidence, and simplified debugging and maintenance.
The TDD process follows a cycle known as "Red, Green, Refactor."
First, a test is written that fails (Red), then the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test is implemented (Green), and finally, the code is refactored to meet quality standards while ensuring all tests still pass (Refactor).

TDD has some important concepts that enhance its effectiveness. The Transformation Priority Premise guides the order in which simple code transformations are applied. Test Doubles, such as mocks and stubs, are used to isolate the unit of code under test, ensuring that tests are focused and effective. The F. R. I. S. T. principles (Fast, Reliable, Isolated, Self-validating, and Timely) are adhered to, ensuring tests are efficient and maintainable. Additionally, the Test Pyramid advocates for a larger number of unit tests at the base, fewer integration tests in the middle, and even fewer end-to-end tests at the top, promoting a balanced approach to testing. While TDD focuses primarily on unit tests, it integrates various test levels to ensure comprehensive test coverage and robust software development.
