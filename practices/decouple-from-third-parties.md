# Decouple from Third Parties

This practice aims to minimize dependencies on third-party software such as frameworks, libraries, and external APIs.
It advocates relying on abstractions like interfaces, enabling the creation of code implementations that are not tightly coupled to specific third-party tools.
Developers can easily switch between different implementations or versions of third-party components without affecting the core logic of their application.

By utilizing interfaces, developers can create mock or stub implementations for testing purposes, facilitating comprehensive unit testing without relying on external resources.
Decoupling code from specific third-party tools enhances its portability across different platforms and environments, it provides the flexibility to migrate to alternative solutions if necessary.
