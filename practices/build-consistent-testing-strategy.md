# Build a Consistent Testing Strategy

Building a consistent testing strategy involves matching your approach to the specific needs of your project and considering the influence of your technology stack.
Prioritize testing critical and complex code areas, and select appropriate types of tests, such as unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
Balance the proportion of each test type, favoring more unit tests and fewer high-cost tests like end-to-end tests.
Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new and modified code by including tests in the definition of done and verifying them during code reviews.
Manage expensive tests by regularly reviewing, deleting, and replacing them with more efficient alternatives.
Integrate tests into the continuous integration pipeline and spread knowledge of the testing strategy and best practices among the development team.

## Nuance

### One-Size-Fits-All Testing Strategy

A common misconception is that a single testing strategy can be applied to all projects.
In reality, each project has unique requirements and constraints, which means that the testing strategy must be customized accordingly.
Factors such as project size, complexity, technology stack, and team expertise influence the choice of testing tools, frameworks, and the balance of different test types.

### Balancing Test Coverage and Maintenance

While comprehensive test coverage is important, it is equally important to balance it with the maintainability of tests.
Over-ambitious coverage goals can lead to a large test suite that is difficult to maintain and slows down the development process.
Focus on covering critical paths and high-risk areas thoroughly, and ensure that tests are easy to update as the codebase evolves.
Regularly refactor tests to keep them relevant and maintainable.

### Excessive End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests are important for verifying the complete functionality of an application, but they are also resource-intensive and time-consuming.
Relying too heavily on end-to-end tests can slow down the continuous integration pipeline and make the testing process less efficient.
Additionally, end-to-end tests are prone to flakiness due to their reliance on multiple integrated components and external dependencies.
When these tests fail intermittently, it can be challenging to pinpoint the exact cause, leading to wasted time investigating false negatives or non-reproducible issues.
To mitigate these challenges, it's advisable to tests with more targeted unit and integration tests that provide faster feedback on specific code functionalities, reducing the overall dependency on end-to-end testing.

### Manual Testing is Obsolete

With the rise of automation, there is a misconception that manual testing is no longer necessary. However, manual exploratory testing plays a critical role in identifying unexpected issues and usability problems that automated tests might miss. Manual testers bring human intuition and creativity to the testing process, uncovering edge cases and user experience issues that automated scripts cannot replicate.


## Key Points

* Choose a Testing Strategy that Matches Your Project Needs: Tailor your testing strategy to fit the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
* Consider Technology Stack Influences: Discuss how the choice of technology influences testing strategies, as different technologies may require different tools and approaches.
* Prioritize Testing for Critical Code Areas: Focus on testing algorithmic parts of the code with high complexity and fewer dependencies, as these are more prone to errors.
* Choose the Right Types of Tests to Implement:
    * Unit Tests: Verify the smallest parts of the application in isolation.
    * Integration Tests: Ensure different modules or services work together correctly.
    * End-to-End Tests: Simulate real user scenarios to test the complete system.
    * Acceptance Tests: Validate that the software meets business requirements and user needs.
    * Performance Tests: Assess the systemâ€™s performance under load and stress conditions.
    * Ephemeral Model-Based Tests: Test dynamic and transient states of the application.
    * Manual Exploratory Testing: Leverage human intuition and creativity to find unexpected issues.
    * Usability Testing: Ensure a positive user experience by testing the user interface and experience.
* Balance the Right Proportion of Each Test Type: Use the test pyramid to guide the proportion of test types, writing fewer high-cost tests (e.g., end-to-end tests) and more low-cost tests (e.g., unit tests).
* Ensure Comprehensive Test Coverage for New and Modified Code:
    * Include Tests in the Definition of Done: Make writing tests a mandatory part of completing any task.
    * Check for Proper Tests in Code Reviews: Verify that appropriate tests are included during code reviews.
* Manage Expensive Tests:
    * Identify Expensive Tests: Regularly review and identify tests that are costly in terms of time, resources, or maintenance.
    * Gradually Delete and Replace Expensive Tests: Remove expensive tests when possible and replace them with more efficient alternatives.
* Run Tests in Continuous Integration: Integrate tests into the continuous integration pipeline to ensure they are run automatically and consistently.
* Spread Knowledge Among the Development Team: Share the designed testing strategy and best practices with the entire development team to ensure everyone is on the same page.
