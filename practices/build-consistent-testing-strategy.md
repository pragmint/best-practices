# Build a Consistent Testing Strategy

Building a consistent testing strategy involves matching your approach to the specific needs of your project and considering the influence of your technology stack.
Prioritize testing critical and complex code areas, and select appropriate types of tests, such as unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
Balance the proportion of each test type, favoring more unit tests and fewer high-cost tests like end-to-end tests.
Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new and modified code by including tests in the definition of done and verifying them during code reviews.
Manage expensive tests by regularly reviewing, deleting, and replacing them with more efficient alternatives.
Integrate tests into the continuous integration pipeline and spread knowledge of the testing strategy and best practices among the development team.

## Key Points

* Choose a Testing Strategy that Matches Your Project Needs: Tailor your testing strategy to fit the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
* Consider Technology Stack Influences: Discuss how the choice of technology influences testing strategies, as different technologies may require different tools and approaches.
* Prioritize Testing for Critical Code Areas: Focus on testing algorithmic parts of the code with high complexity and fewer dependencies, as these are more prone to errors.
* Choose the Right Types of Tests to Implement:
    * Unit Tests: Verify the smallest parts of the application in isolation.
    * Integration Tests: Ensure different modules or services work together correctly.
    * End-to-End Tests: Simulate real user scenarios to test the complete system.
    * Acceptance Tests: Validate that the software meets business requirements and user needs.
    * Performance Tests: Assess the systemâ€™s performance under load and stress conditions.
    * Ephemeral Model-Based Tests: Test dynamic and transient states of the application.
    * Manual Exploratory Testing: Leverage human intuition and creativity to find unexpected issues.
    * Usability Testing: Ensure a positive user experience by testing the user interface and experience.
* Balance the Right Proportion of Each Test Type: Use the test pyramid to guide the proportion of test types, writing fewer high-cost tests (e.g., end-to-end tests) and more low-cost tests (e.g., unit tests).
* Ensure Comprehensive Test Coverage for New and Modified Code:
    * Include Tests in the Definition of Done: Make writing tests a mandatory part of completing any task.
    * Check for Proper Tests in Code Reviews: Verify that appropriate tests are included during code reviews.
* Manage Expensive Tests:
    * Identify Expensive Tests: Regularly review and identify tests that are costly in terms of time, resources, or maintenance.
    * Gradually Delete and Replace Expensive Tests: Remove expensive tests when possible and replace them with more efficient alternatives.
* Run Tests in Continuous Integration: Integrate tests into the continuous integration pipeline to ensure they are run automatically and consistently.
* Spread Knowledge Among the Development Team: Share the designed testing strategy and best practices with the entire development team to ensure everyone is on the same page.
