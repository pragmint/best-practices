# Run Pair Programming Sessions

Run Pair Programming Sessions involve two developers collaborating either at one workstation or remotely, with one typing out code (the driver) and the other reviewing.
This practice enhances code quality by facilitating constant review, improving knowledge sharing, discussion, and problem-solving.
It also serves as a mentoring tool.
When developers don't engage in Pair Programming, bugs increase, knowledge silos form, problem-solving becomes slower, and teams miss opportunities for skill development.
Effective Pair Programming requires clear communication, mutual respect, regular role rotation, and a supportive team culture that values collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Nuances

### Balancing Individual and Collaborative Work

While Run Pair Programming Sessions emphasize collaboration, it's essential to balance them with individual work.
Over-reliance on pair programming for all tasks may limit developers' autonomy and creativity.
Some tasks may benefit from individual exploration and problem-solving before collaboration.

### Managing Pair Dynamics

Rotating pairs fosters diverse perspectives, mitigates dependency, while alternating roles between Driver and Reviewer promotes skill development and engagement.
Relying too heavily on a single pair can create bottlenecks and knowledge silos.
It's important to encourage pairing across the team and ensure that knowledge is shared widely to mitigate risks associated with individual dependencies.

Continuous pair programming sessions without breaks can lead to burnout and fatigue, diminishing the effectiveness of collaboration. Teams should take regular breaks, rotate pairs frequently, and encourage developers to take time for individual reflection.

### Recognizing Contextual Suitability

Pair programming may not be suitable for all tasks or project phases. Complex problem-solving, code reviews, and knowledge transfer are ideal scenarios for PP sessions.
However, routine tasks or individual research may not require constant collaboration and may be more efficiently handled independently.

### Adapting to Remote Collaboration Challenges

While Pair Programming can be done remotely, has some challenges such as communication barriers, technical issues, and time zone differences.
Teams must use in suitable collaboration tools (Like VS Code Live Share) and establish clear communication protocols.

## How to Improve

### [Lead Workshops](/practices/lead-workshops.md)

#### Trial Period

To experiment with pair programming and evaluate its effects, start by pairing team members for a designated period, such as one or two weeks. Assign tasks to pairs, ensuring a mix of experience levels if possible. Rotate pairs frequently to encourage diverse collaboration. During each session, have one person in the "driver" role, actively writing code, while the other acts as the "navigator," providing real-time feedback and suggestions. Encourage pairs to switch roles regularly. Monitor the outcomes by gathering feedback on code quality, productivity, and team satisfaction. Additionally, observe any improvements in knowledge sharing, problem-solving efficiency, and team cohesion.

### [Host A Retrospective](/practices/host-a-retrospective.md)

#### Feedback Sessions

Regular feedback sessions provide an opportunity for team members to share their experiences, challenges, and suggestions regarding Pair Programming.
By collecting feedback from participants, you can identify areas for improvement, address concerns, and iterate on the Pair Programming process.
This continuous feedback loop enables you to refine your approach to Pair Programming and ensure that it aligns with your team's needs and goals.

#### [Strengthening the Case for Pair Programming](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/ieeeSoftware.PDF)

This article focuses on the benefits of pair programming. It argues that pair programming leads to higher-quality code, faster development, and increased programmer satisfaction, based on both anecdotal evidence and structured experiments. The article presents data from professional programmers and students, showing that pair programming is more efficient despite initial skepticism. It also highlights pair programming's role in the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology, emphasizing its effectiveness across all levels of programming skill.

### [Host A Viewing Party](/practices/host-a-viewing-party.md)

#### [Async Code Reviews Are Chocking Your Companyâ€™s Throughput](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlLZEQQBcFg)

In his presentation, Dragan delves into the common practice of pull/merge requests (PRs) in software development teams and its potential impact on throughput.
Drawing from his study analyzing tens of thousands of PRs across various repositories, he reveals that teams utilizing small PRs with asynchronous code reviews often experience lower throughput compared to those employing larger PRs.
However, Dragan introduces a solution to this dilemma through co-creation patterns such as pair and mob programming, where multiple individuals collaborate simultaneously on a task.
By exploring data that challenges the assumption that this collaborative approach diminishes team throughput, Dragan suggests a path toward achieving both high throughput and quality in software development.

## Supporting Capabilities

### [Code Maintainability](/capabilities/code-maintainability.md)

Pair Programming directly supports Code Maintainability by facilitating collaboration, real-time code review, and knowledge sharing among developers. By working in pairs, developers catch issues early, ensure code comprehensibility, and spread knowledge across the team, leading to a more maintainable codebase. Additionally, Pair Programming promotes adherence to coding standards, enhancing code consistency and readability.
