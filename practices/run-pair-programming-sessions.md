# Run Pair Programming Sessions

Run Pair Programming Sessions involve two developers collaborating either at one workstation or remotely, with one typing out code (the driver) and the other reviewing.
This practice enhances code quality by facilitating constant review, improving knowledge sharing, discussion, and problem-solving.
It also serves as a mentoring tool.
When developers don't engage in Pair Programming, bugs increase, knowledge silos form, problem-solving becomes slower, and teams miss opportunities for skill development.
Effective Pair Programming requires clear communication, mutual respect, regular role rotation, and a supportive team culture that values collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Nuances

### Balancing Individual and Collaborative Work

While Run Pair Programming Sessions emphasize collaboration, it's essential to balance them with individual work.
Over-reliance on pair programming for all tasks may limit developers' autonomy and creativity.
Some tasks may benefit from individual exploration and problem-solving before collaboration.
