# Run Pair Programming Sessions

Run Pair Programming Sessions involve two developers collaborating either at one workstation or remotely, with one typing out code (the driver) and the other reviewing.
This practice enhances code quality by facilitating constant review, improving knowledge sharing, discussion, and problem-solving.
It also serves as a mentoring tool.
When developers don't engage in Pair Programming, bugs increase, knowledge silos form, problem-solving becomes slower, and teams miss opportunities for skill development.
Effective Pair Programming requires clear communication, mutual respect, regular role rotation, and a supportive team culture that values collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Nuances

### Balancing Individual and Collaborative Work

While Run Pair Programming Sessions emphasize collaboration, it's essential to balance them with individual work.
Over-reliance on pair programming for all tasks may limit developers' autonomy and creativity.
Some tasks may benefit from individual exploration and problem-solving before collaboration.

### Managing Pair Dynamics

Rotating pairs fosters diverse perspectives, mitigates dependency, while alternating roles between Driver and Reviewer promotes skill development and engagement.
Relying too heavily on a single pair can create bottlenecks and knowledge silos.
It's important to encourage pairing across the team and ensure that knowledge is shared widely to mitigate risks associated with individual dependencies.

Continuous pair programming sessions without breaks can lead to burnout and fatigue, diminishing the effectiveness of collaboration. Teams should take regular breaks, rotate pairs frequently, and encourage developers to take time for individual reflection.

### Recognizing Contextual Suitability

Pair programming may not be suitable for all tasks or project phases. Complex problem-solving, code reviews, and knowledge transfer are ideal scenarios for PP sessions.
However, routine tasks or individual research may not require constant collaboration and may be more efficiently handled independently.

### Adapting to Remote Collaboration Challenges

While Pair Programming can be done remotely, has some challenges such as communication barriers, technical issues, and time zone differences.
Teams must use in suitable collaboration tools (Like VS Code Live Share) and establish clear communication protocols.

## Introspective Questions

### Maximizing the Effectiveness of Pair Programming:

* How frequently do we engage in Pair Programming sessions, and are they integrated into our regular workflow?
* How do we measure the effectiveness of Pair Programming in terms of code quality, knowledge sharing, and team collaboration, and what adjustments can we make to improve outcomes?
* Are Pair Programming sessions adapted to suit different project phases and tasks, ensuring that they are utilized where they add the most value?

### Reflecting on Pair Dynamics and Team Culture:

* How do we manage pair dynamics to foster diverse perspectives and mitigate dependency on individual team members?
* What steps can we take to encourage pairing across the team and prevent reliance on a single pair, which could lead to bottlenecks?
* Are team members encouraged to take on both the role of driver and reviewer during Pair Programming sessions to promote skill development and engagement?

### Evaluating Contextual Suitability and Adaptability:

* Are there specific tasks or project phases where Pair Programming is particularly effective, and how do we identify these opportunities?
* What tools and protocols do we have in place to address challenges associated with remote Pair Programming, such as communication barriers and time zone differences?
* How do we ensure that team members are equipped with the necessary skills and resources to effectively engage in Pair Programming?

## Exercises

### Trial Period
Implementing a trial period allows your team to directly experience Pair Programming in action. By committing to regular Pair Programming sessions for a defined period, such as a week or two, you can observe firsthand how it affects code quality, knowledge sharing, and team collaboration. This hands-on experience provides valuable insights into whether Pair Programming is a suitable practice for your team and organization.

### Pairing Rotation
Rotating pairs frequently within the team is crucial for including diverse perspectives, mitigating dependency, and promoting skill development.
Assigning different pairs for various tasks or user stories allows team members to collaborate with different individuals and learn from each other's expertise.
By assessing how pairing rotation impacts knowledge sharing, team dynamics, and skill development, you can determine the effectiveness of Pair Programming in your team.

### Feedback Sessions
Regular feedback sessions provide an opportunity for team members to share their experiences, challenges, and suggestions regarding Pair Programming.
By collecting feedback from participants, you can identify areas for improvement, address concerns, and iterate on the Pair Programming process.
This continuous feedback loop enables you to refine your approach to Pair Programming and ensure that it aligns with your team's needs and goals.

### [Async Code Reviews Are Chocking Your Companyâ€™s Throughput](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlLZEQQBcFg)

In his presentation, Dragan delves into the common practice of pull/merge requests (PRs) in software development teams and its potential impact on throughput.
Drawing from his study analyzing tens of thousands of PRs across various repositories, he reveals that teams utilizing small PRs with asynchronous code reviews often experience lower throughput compared to those employing larger PRs.
However, Dragan introduces a solution to this dilemma through co-creation patterns such as pair and mob programming, where multiple individuals collaborate simultaneously on a task.
By exploring data that challenges the assumption that this collaborative approach diminishes team throughput, Dragan suggests a path toward achieving both high throughput and quality in software development.
