# Version Dependencies

The practice of Version Dependencies involves managing application dependencies by versioning and referencing them through specific versions. This approach ensures consistency, reliability, and traceability in software development projects by maintaining a clear record of all dependency versions used within an application.

## Nuance

### Regular Updates Required:
Even with strict version control, dependencies must be regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities, bugs, and performance issues. This requires a balance between maintaining stability and incorporating necessary changes.

### Avoiding Dependency Hell:
Managing a complex web of dependencies can lead to "dependency hell," where updating one dependency necessitates cascading updates, potentially causing compatibility issues across the project.

### Locking Dependencies and Automated tools
To ensure stability and predictability in software projects, we recommend to lock dependencies to specific versions.
However, this approach requires a strategy to stay updated with the latest fixes and improvements and security patches.
Automated tools like Dependabot facilitate keep the dependencies updated across projects.
They monitor dependencies for new versions, and can automatically create pull requests to update to these newer versions.

## Introspective Questions

### How Effective Is Your Dependency Management?
How effectively is your team currently managing dependency versions, and could a more systematic approach to version control improve project consistency and reliability?

### How Are You Addressing Dependency Hell?
Have you encountered issues with "dependency hell," and what strategies could you implement to mitigate these challenges while maintaining strict version control?

### How Often Do You Review Your Update Policies?
Is your current policy for updating dependencies proactive or reactive?
How often do you review dependency versions for potential updates, and could this process be optimized?

### Are you using using tools to automate dependency updates?
Are automatic dependency update tools suitable for your project?
Could you benefit from using tools like Dependendabot, Renovate or Snyk to have dependency update pull requests generated automatically?

## How to Improve

### [Lead Workshops](/practices/lead-workshops.md)

#### Audit Your Current Dependency Management

To assess the current state of dependency management within your team or organization. A comprehensive report detailing which dependencies are managed effectively and which are not, identifying potential areas for improvement.

#### Dependency Update Policy Review

To review and potentially revise your current policies on updating dependencies. A refined update policy that balances the need for updates with the desire for stability, possibly leading to more efficient and secure project development.

#### Simulate a Dependency Hell Scenario

To simulate a "dependency hell" scenario to understand its impact and identify strategies for mitigation. Practical experience in managing complex dependency chains, leading to improved strategies for avoiding or dealing with dependency hell in real projects.

### [Do A Spike](/practices/do-a-spike.md)

#### Implement Semantic Versioning on a Small Scale

To experiment with semantic versioning by applying it to a small, manageable portion of your project. Insights into how semantic versioning affects project stability and the process of updating dependencies, helping you decide if a broader implementation is beneficial.

#### Implement Automatic Dependency Updates tool

Lock mayor dependencies in your project and configure Dependabot or a similar tool, to generate PRs when new version of dependencies are published. Understand how automatic dependency update tools impact your work flow and the overall stability of the project.

#### [Dependencies Belong in Version Control](https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/dependencies-belong-in-version-control/)

This article explores the importance of including dependencies within version control systems to ensure consistency, reliability, and traceability in software development projects. It discusses the benefits and methodologies of version controlling dependencies, offering insights into best practices for managing software dependencies effectively.

## Supporting Capabilities

### [Continuous Integration](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/continuous-integration/)
**Relationship:** Enables
Version Controlled Dependencies ensure that all team members work with the same versions of dependencies, reducing integration conflicts and enabling more efficient continuous integration processes.

### [Database Change Management](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/database-change-management/)
**Relationship:** Enables
By versioning database schema changes alongside code dependencies, teams can apply version control practices to database changes as well, facilitating smoother migrations and deployments.

### [Deployment Automation](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/deployment-automation/)
**Relationship:** Enables
Having dependencies version-controlled allows for more predictable deployments, as the exact versions used in development are carried through to production environments, supporting automated deployment pipelines.

### [Version Control](/capabilities/version-control.md)
**Relationship:** Requires
The practice of Version Dependencies inherently requires a robust version control system to manage the dependencies' versions alongside the application's source code.

### [Documentation Quality](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/process/documentation-quality/)
**Relationship:** Improves
Proper versioning of dependencies can improve documentation quality by providing clear references to the specific versions of external libraries or frameworks used, making the documentation more accurate and useful.

### [Working in Small Batches](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/process/working-in-small-batches/)
**Relationship:** Improves
Version Controlled Dependencies support working in small batches by making it easier to manage and integrate small, incremental changes to dependencies, aligning with best practices for agile and DevOps methodologies.
