# Refactor

Refactoring is a disciplined technique in software development that involves restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior.
The goal is to improve code readability, reduce complexity, and enhance maintainability. Refactoring should be done continuously and in small increments to minimize errors and ease tracking.
Changes should be made through a series of small transformations, applied from the least to the most disruptive.
This practice maintain the code's capacity to change and adapt effectively over time.
