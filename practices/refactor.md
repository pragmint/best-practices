# Refactor

Refactoring is a disciplined technique in software development that involves restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior.
The goal is to improve code readability, reduce complexity, and enhance maintainability.
Refactoring should be done continuously and in small increments to minimize errors and avoid being overwhelmed by large-scale changes or causing conflicts with team members who might be working on the same parts of the code.
Changes should be made through a series of small transformations, applied from the least to the most disruptive. This practice maintains the code's capacity to change and adapt effectively over time.

## Nuance

### Common Misconceptions

A common misconception is that refactoring involves adding new features, functionality, or improving the user experience (UX).
In reality, refactoring is solely about improving the structure of existing code without altering its external behavior.
Its focus is on enhancing the code’s readability, maintainability, and performance, not changing it's output.

### Automated Testing is Crucial

Refactoring should be supported by a robust suite of automated tests.
These tests ensure that the changes made during refactoring do not introduce new bugs.
Without adequate testing, it becomes difficult to guarantee that the code’s behavior remains consistent after modifications.

### The Risks of Too Much in One Go

Attempting too much in a single refactor can increase complexity, introduce errors, and slow progress.
It's important to break tasks into smaller, manageable units to maintain clarity, reduce errors, and enhance the codebase incrementally.
Doing too much at once can be overwhelming and create conflicts with other team members.

### Prolonged Gaps Between Refactors

Allowing too much time to elapse between refactoring sessions can lead to numerous challenges.
Code-bases left unattended for extended periods often accumulate technical debt, making subsequent refactors more daunting and time-consuming.
To mitigate this, it's important to adopt a strategy of frequent, incremental refactoring rather than waiting for issues to pile up.
By addressing small improvements continuously, developers can maintain code quality, reduce the accumulation of technical debt, and ensure the codebase remains easy to work with over time.

### Refactoring Legacy Code Requires Careful Planning

Refactoring legacy code requires careful planning due to its complexity and potential lack of tests.
An incremental approach is essential, making small, manageable changes to avoid introducing new errors.
Focus on identifying and isolating specific areas that need improvement, and implement testing around these areas to ensure behavior remains consistent.
Prioritize high-impact areas to maximize the benefits of refactoring efforts.
Gradually integrate changes to avoid overwhelming the system and facilitate smooth transitions, ensuring the codebase improves and remains stable over time.

### Monitoring and Roll-back

Monitoring and roll-back infrastructure is important in managing regressions during refactoring.
Monitoring tools provide real-time feedback on application performance and behavior, enabling quick detection of issues introduced by refactoring.
Combined with a robust roll-back system, teams can revert changes if regressions occur, minimizing disruption to users.
This dual approach ensures the application remains stable and consistent, maintaining the integrity of the codebase while allowing continuous improvement.

### Trunk-based Development

Trunk-based development, with its focus on continuous integration, is highly conducive to continuous refactoring.
By committing changes directly to the mainline, developers can refactor incrementally, ensuring ongoing improvement.
This approach promotes a culture of collaboration, as changes are immediately visible to the entire team.
The fast feedback loop allows for quick identification and resolution of any issues.

## How to Improve

### [Lead A Demonstration](/practices/lead-a-demonstration.md)

### [Lead Workshops](/practices/lead-workshops.md)

#### Incremental and Frequent Refactoring

Organize a dedicated part of a sprint to refactoring, where the team focuses on incremental improvements.
Break down the codebase into small, manageable units and assign each unit to team members.
Use automated tests to validate each change.

#### Refactoring Legacy Code Workshop

Organize a workshop focused on refactoring a specific section of legacy code.
Start by identifying high-impact areas that require improvement.
Develop a plan to implement small, incremental changes and establish a set of tests to ensure behavior remains consistent.
Execute the refactoring plan, closely monitoring for any issues.
This exercise will highlight the challenges and strategies involved in refactoring legacy code and emphasize the importance of careful planning and incremental progress.

## Supporting Capabilities

### [Code Maintainability](/capabilities/code-maintainability.md)

Refactoring, as a practice, significantly supports the Code Maintainability Capability by systematically improving code structure, readability, and quality. Through incremental changes and adherence to coding standards, it addresses complexity and technical debt, ensuring the code remains clean, modular, and comprehensible. By integrating refactoring into regular development cycles, teams establish a foundation of maintainable code, enabling efficient delivery, stability, and ongoing innovation.

### [Version Control](/capabilities/version-control.md)

Version control and refactoring in software development go hand in hand.
Version control tracks code changes over time, facilitating collaboration and reversibility.
Refactoring improves code structure without altering behavior.
Together, they enable teams to systematically enhance code quality, with version control tracking and integrating improvements with confidence.
