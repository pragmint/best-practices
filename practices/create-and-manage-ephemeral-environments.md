# Create and Manage Ephemeral Environments

Creating and managing ephemeral environments involves setting up temporary, production-like environments that mimic the live system.
These environments are transient, existing only for the duration needed for testing, development, or other purposes.
The key benefits include reducing conflicts in development, simplifying troubleshooting and debugging, ensuring reproducibility across different setups, and saving resources by eliminating the need for long-lived testing environments.
Ephemeral environments can be automated using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), integrated into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline processes, and can even handle production traffic to assess performance and reliability against real-world conditions.
Overall, this practice enhances agility, scalability, and reliability in software development and testing workflows.

## Key Points

* Explanation of the is an Ephemeral Environment
* Ephemeral Environment should be similar to production
* Reduce conflict in the development process
* Ease troubleshooting and debugging
* Reproducibility Reduce "it works in my machine" issue
* Save resources by eliminating the need for long-lived testing environments.
* Easily scale the number of environments based on current testing needs.
* Could be automated using IaC
* CI/CD, create and destroy environments as part of the process
* Run production traffic against ephemeral environment to compare performance and reliability.
