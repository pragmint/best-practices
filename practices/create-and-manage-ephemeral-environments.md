# Create and Manage Ephemeral Environments

Creating and managing ephemeral environments involves setting up temporary, production-like environments that mimic the live system.
These environments are transient, existing only for the duration needed for testing, development, or other purposes.
If done well, ephemeral environments can make manual and automated testing in an integrated environment simple and reliable.
Ephemeral environments can be automated using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), updated via Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and can sometimes handle copies of production traffic to assess performance and reliability against real-world conditions.

## Nuance

### Achieving Full Production Parity

One common misconception about ephemeral environments is the belief that they should perfectly replicate production conditions, but achieving this level of parity can be prohibitively expensive for many companies.
Instead, the primary goal of ephemeral environments is to make it easy and convenient for developers to spin up a simulated environment on-demand, allowing them to focus on getting their work done efficiently without worrying about the cost or complexity of maintaining a near replica of production.
Each company will have its own unique balance between cost and value when it comes to using ephemeral environments.

### Security and Data Privacy

Security and data privacy are important considerations when implementing ephemeral environments.
Handling sensitive data in transient setups requires careful planning to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and safeguard against unauthorized access.
Only populate ephemeral environments with sensitive or valuable data if/when required.
Robust access controls, monitoring, and logging mechanisms should be in place to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
This ensures that despite the temporary nature of ephemeral environments, data integrity and confidentiality are maintained at all times.

### Application Complexity and Compatibility

Legacy systems or applications with intricate dependencies may face challenges in ephemeral deployment due to compatibility issues or operational constraints.
In such cases, adopting a hybrid approach—integrating both ephemeral and persistent environments strategically—can help strike a balance between flexibility and compliance.

## Supporting Capabilities

### [Continuous Integration](/capabilities/continuous-integration.md)

Ephemeral environments enable developers to easily integrate and verify their code changes into a running environment that nothing else depends on. This reduces the risk of integrating broken changes, promoting a higher quantity of integrations.

### [Test Automation](/capabilities/test-automation.md)

Ephemeral environments make it easier to support automated tests that need to run in realistic / integrated environments without affecting any shared environments that other developers or end users depend on. For example, load testing is great, but sometimes they can affect the performance of the system under test. If multiple teams or upstream systems depend on that degraded system, unexpected issues may result.

### [Test Data Management](/capabilities/test-data-management.md)

For ephemeral environments to be effective, it's important for a good test data management system to be in place.

### [Version Control](/capabilities/version-control.md)

If an ephemeral environment's infrastructure, code, configuration, and data is under version control, then it will increase the usefulness of the environment. When developers can pull different versions off of the shelf to suit their needs, then it becomes easier to reproduce issues that only occur when a specific combination of infrastructure, code, configuration, and data exists.
