# Lead A Demonstration

Leading a demonstration is an excellent way to engage an audience by live coding, showcasing customer feedback, or presenting on a specific topic. Demonstrations can vary in length, from brief lightning talks to more extended sessions, and can be conducted as one-off events or as part of a regular series. This format is particularly effective for introducing new topics or ideas, as it allows the presenter to provide a clear and focused explanation. Including a Q&A session at the end or during the demonstration can enhance understanding and provide immediate clarification. However, this approach is less effective for spurring in-depth discussions, as the primary focus is on delivering content rather than fostering interactive dialogue.

## Nuance

### Don't Cover Too Much Ground

Stay focused on one or two main points to avoid overwhelming your audience. Providing a deep dive into specific topics makes your content more digestible and allows for meaningful audience interaction.

### Anyone Can Do It

Anyone, regardless of experience level, can lead a demonstration. Preparation and passion for the subject are key. Sharing your unique perspective can create a meaningful and impactful presentation. Encourage all developers to lead presentations.

### Not Great For Tacit Knowledge Transfer

Demonstrations are excellent for explicit knowledge but less effective for tacit knowledge, which requires interactive and collaborative approaches like workshops or mentoring for comprehensive understanding and skill development.

### Great For Stakeholders And Collaborators Alike

An often overlooked aspect of building great software is building trust with your stakeholders and collaborators. Leading demonstrations can do wonders towards that end.

## Introspective Questions

- Do I have any context or points of view that others don't have?
- How can I craft a demonstration to be thought-provoking and engaging?
- Are there little touches I can add to the experience for the attendees?

### [Host A Roundtable Discussion](/practices/host-a-roundtable-discussion.md)

If your Q&A session runs long, you may want to schedule a roundtable discussion on the topcis your demonstration covered. That way attendees get more chances to play around with the ideas in their heads.

### [Lead Workshops](/practices/lead-workshops.md)

It may be a good idea to cover your topic with a workshop following a presentation / demonstration. Doing so will increase the chances that your ideas will be applied by the people you're trying to impart knowledge onto.

### [Host A Viewing Party](/practices/host-a-viewing-party.md)

If you or someone else has already recorded a demonstration that adequately covers the topics you wish to share, you can run a watch party instead of giving the presentation.

### [Start A Community Of Practice](/practices/start-a-community-of-practice.md)

Finding or starting relevant Communities of Practice can be a great place to lead a demonstration. The audience has already self selected themselves to join with the hopes of learning.

## Supporting Capabilities

### [Learning Culture](/capabilities/learning-culture.md)

Organizations that host demonstrations / presentations tend to value learning as a part of their culture.
