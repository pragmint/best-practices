# Automate Test Coverage Checks

Automating test coverage checks enhances development efficiency and code quality by setting realistic thresholds for different application modules.
Integrating these checks into CI pipelines ensures continuous validation without slowing down development.
However, teams should avoid relying solely on coverage metrics and include non-functional tests like performance and security checks for comprehensive software validation.
This approach optimizes workflow while maintaining rigorous testing standards across the codebase.

## Key Points

* Improves development workflow.

* Realistic coverage thresholds.

* Different Coverage Thresholds for different modules in the application.

* CI Pipeline Integration (Non-blocking).

* Over-reliance on coverage metrics without considering test quality.

* Neglecting non-functional tests (performance, security).
