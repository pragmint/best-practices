# Automate Test Coverage Checks

## Key Points

* Improves development workflow.

* Realistic coverage thresholds.

* Different Coverage Thresholds for different modules in the application.

* CI Pipeline Integration (Non-blocking).

* Over-reliance on coverage metrics without considering test quality.

* Neglecting non-functional tests (performance, security).
