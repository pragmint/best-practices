# Automate Database Migrations

Automate Database Migrations is a practice for managing and evolving a database schema over time through version-controlled scripts. These scripts enable incremental changes, such as adding features or fixing issues, while maintaining data integrity. This approach includes rollback capabilities, allowing any modifications to be safely reversed if necessary. It aligns with [Evolutionary Database Design](/practices/automate-database-migrations.md#evolutionary-database-design), promoting adaptability and risk mitigation by integrating changes smoothly into development workflows. This method is key for supporting continuous integration and deployment and minimizing disruption.

## Nuance

### Version Control Integration
Integrating automatic database (db) migrations with version control systems is crucial for tracking and coordinating changes among team members. This ensures that every modification to the database schema is documented, reviewed, and synchronized with the corresponding application code changes, enhancing collaboration and minimizing conflicts. It is also preferred to have the migration scripts live in the same repository as the application code that operates on that database (assuming there is only one application that serves this role for that particular db/table/whatever). Doing this ensures the assumptions that the application makes of the db schema are correct and up to date.

### Data Transformation and Migration
In addition to schema changes, migrations might involve transforming existing data or migrating data between tables or formats. These operations can be complex and risk data integrity, requiring thorough testing and validation to ensure accuracy and completeness. Generally speaking, it is best practice to avoid breaking schema changes by adding new tables/columns as they're needed and deleting old ones only after ensuring they're no longer necessary. It can be tempting to simply update a column in place, which can introduce timing issues during deployments and/or integrity issues during rollbacks.

### Rollback Strategies
While the ability to rollback changes is a fundamental aspect of automatic database migrations, designing effective rollback strategies is nuanced. It involves not just reverting schema changes but also considering the impact on data that has been modified or added since the migration was applied.

### Migrations Execution Sequence
One should build their migrations to avoid sequential dependencies. However, sometimes there's no avoiding that situation and errors can occur if migrations are not executed in the right order. In these rare situations, frequent communication between team members helps to reduce these types of errors.

### Testing and Validation
Every application's testing needs are going to vary based on the architectural constraints, team norms, tech stack, etc. Generally speaking, it's a good idea to have some way to automate verification that the database is structured as expected. This can be accomplished in many ways: end to end tests, regression tests, production monitoring / alerting, etc. Select a verification strategy that gives developers the confidence they need without introducing too much complexity or reducing the reliability of the build process.

### Performance Considerations
Large-scale migrations can significantly impact database performance, especially in production environments. Planning for off-peak execution times, batch processing, and incremental migrations are strategies to mitigate performance degradation during the migration process.

### NoSQL Databases
When considering migrations for NoSQL databases, it's essential to embrace schema flexibility by supporting multiple schema versions concurrently and allowing application logic to handle different data structures dynamically. Instead of enforcing strict schema updates through upgrade scripts, use a schema version identifier and implement incremental updates or "lazy" migrations as data is accessed. This approach maintains application compatibility across schema changes while reducing downtime and ensuring consistent data accessibility.

## Introspective Questions

### Alignment with Development Workflow
How well do our automatic database migration processes integrate with our current development, testing, and deployment workflows? Are there points of friction, and how can we address them?

### Version Control Harmony
Are our migration scripts and database schema changes properly version-controlled alongside our application code? How can we improve traceability and coordination between code and database changes?

### Sequential Dependency Handling
How effectively do we manage sequential dependencies within our migration scripts? Are there tools or practices we could adopt to better handle complex migrations and dependency chains?

### Data Integrity Safeguards
What measures do we have in place to ensure data integrity during migrations? How do we test and validate data before and after migrations to prevent loss or corruption?

### Rollback Readiness
How confident are we in our ability to rollback a migration in case of failure? Do we have a tested and reliable process for reverting changes without affecting data integrity?

### Performance Impact Assessment
Have we experienced performance impacts during migrations? How can we minimize downtime and performance degradation, especially in production environments?

### Monitoring and Alerting
Do we have adequate monitoring and alerting in place to detect and respond to issues during the migration process? How can we improve real-time visibility into migrations?

### Continuous Improvement
What lessons have we learned from past migrations, and how are we applying these insights to improve future processes? Are there emerging tools or practices that could enhance our migration strategy?

## How to Improve

### [Lead Workshops](/practices/lead-workshops.md)

#### Create a Simple Migration Script

Learn the basics of writing a migration script by creating a simple script that adds a new table to your database. Choose a database migration tool compatible with your database system (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, etc). Write a migration script to create a new table with at least three columns: an ID, a name, and a timestamp. Run the migration script against your local development database. Verify the table was created successfully by querying the database.

#### Implementing Rollbacks

Understand the rollback process by writing a script that undoes a migration. Using the migration script from Exercise 1, write a rollback script that removes the table. Apply the rollback script to your development database. Confirm that the table has been successfully removed.

#### Handling Complex Migrations

Gain experience with complex migrations involving data transformations. Write a migration script that alters an existing table by adding a new column. Populate the new column with data transformed from existing columns (e.g., concatenating two columns into a new one). Apply the migration and verify the data transformation was successful.
