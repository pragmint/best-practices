# Use SPIN To Unearth Problems and Solutions

SPIN Selling is a practice that focuses on understanding a person's needs through four types of questions: Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-Payoff. By identifying and addressing the someone's pain points and the consequences of inaction, the question asker guides the person to recognize the value of the solution being offered. Below is a more detailed breakdown of each category of question:

* Situation: questions that collect facts, information, and background data about the existing situation.
* Problem: questions that probe for problems, difficulties, or dissatisfaction.
* Implication: questions that develop the seriousness of an implied need and increase the size of the problem.
* Need-Payoff: questions that build up the value or usefulness of the solution.

Software professionals can use SPIN to generate buy-in on a new idea. This occurs when there is a high level of agreement in the problems and implications of those problems existing.

Let's say there is a team struggling to get timely code review from a centralized reviewer. Someone could use the SPIN framework with the centralized reviewer to establish the importance of solving this problem. See the example conversation below:

```text
Situation Q: How many pull requests do you review each day?
A: It depends, but usually somewhere between 6 and 10.

Problem Q: Is it hard to juggle that many pull requests every day? How much of your feedback is repetitive?
A: Yeah, the context switching is difficult and a large percentage of the feedback I provide winds up covering a similar selection of topics.

Implication Q: What are you unable to do now because of the effort required to stay on top of these reviews?
A: I'm so behind on doing actual programming. Right now, it's taking me twice as long to finish my work.

Need Payoff Q: If there was a way to automatically post relevant feedback to a pull request from a knowledge base you maintain using AI, how much time would that save you?
A: If it worked well, that would probably cut my review time in half.
```

The above example shows how following SPIN can set the stage for the need before offering a solution. It's common for people to dive straight into the solution, which can lessen the chances of generating buy-in.
