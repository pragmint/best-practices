# Use SPIN To Unearth Problems and Solutions

SPIN is a technique which is designed to unearth problems and solutions by asking different kinds of questions. While these questions serve value when asked to decision makers, they can also be asked inwardly.
It's an acronym for:
* Situation Questions: questions that collect facts, information, and background data about the existing situation.
* Problem Questions: questions that probe for problems, difficulties, or dissatisfaction.
* Implication Questions: questions that develop the seriousness of an implied need and increase the size of the problem.
* Need-Payoff Questions: questions that build up the value or usefulness of the solution.

Other useful terms:

* Implied Needs: Statements of problems, difficulties, and dissatisfaction.
* Explicit Needs: Specific statements of wants or desires.

It also provides a path for getting buy in from others. For example, convincing a team to write unit tests is not as simple as telling the team to write unit tests. Using the SPIN model takes the team on a journey and clearly conveys the implications of not having unit tests and the benefits of adopting unit testing.

### The Spin Model
Use SITUATION QUESTIONS to establish context,
leading to PROBLEM QUESTIONS so that the IMPLIED NEEDS are revealed,
which are developed by IMPLICATION QUESTIONS,
which makes the impact of the problem more clear and accurate,
leading to NEED-PAYOFF QUESTIONS so that the EXPLICIT NEEDS are identified,
allowing the BENEFITS to be identified,
which are strongly related to success.
