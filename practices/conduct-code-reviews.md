# Conduct Code Reviews

Code review is a crucial part of software development, where peers examine code changes to ensure quality and reliability; it helps catch bugs, enforce best practices, and promote collaboration. Having clear guidelines for code reviews, along with using checklists that can be continuously refined during retrospectives, is important for ensuring consistency, improving the quality of reviews, and fostering continuous improvement in the development process.
Automating parts of code review helps ensure consistency, save time, and allows people to focus on more important tasks, making the software development process better and faster.
Many aspects of code review can be automated, including checking for coding standards compliance, syntax errors, test coverage, static code analysis, dependency management, performance profiling, and documentation generation.

## Nuance

### Contextual Understanding

Reviewers need to understand the broader context of the changes being made, including user requirements.
Lacking this context can result in misguided feedback or approval of suboptimal solutions.
Ideally, the reviewer should engage in pair programming with the author during the development process.
This collaboration provides an opportunity to gain context, understand the rationale behind design decisions, 
and grasp the intricacies of the code changes, thus resulting in a more informed and insightful code review.

### Accounting for Subjectivity

Different developers may have varying opinions on code style, architecture, and implementation details.
It's important to recognize that some feedback may be subjective and prioritize changes that align with the project's overall objectives rather than personal preferences.

### Managing Workload

Code reviews can become a bottleneck if not managed effectively.
Teams should establish clear guidelines for review turnaround times and distribute review responsibilities evenly.
It's important for the team to agree on strategies to avoid long pull requests, as these can overwhelm reviewers and lead to delays.

### Feedback Sensitivity

Giving and receiving feedback during code reviews requires tact and diplomacy.
Developers should be mindful of how their comments are phrased to avoid demoralizing colleagues or creating a hostile environment.
At the same time developers should be open to constructive criticism and view it as an opportunity for growth.

### Checklists

Using checklists to conduct code reviews helps ensure consistency and thoroughness in the evaluation process.
However, it's important to note that checklists should not remain static; rather, they should be continuously refined during retrospectives.
This involves soliciting feedback from team members and incorporating lessons learned from previous reviews to improve the effectiveness of the checklist over time.
