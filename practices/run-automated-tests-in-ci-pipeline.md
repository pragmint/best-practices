# Run Automated Tests In An Integration/Deployment Pipeline

## Key Points

* Benefits of Running Tests in CI Pipeline
    * Early detection of defects
    * Reduced integration problems
    * Improved code quality and reliability
    * Faster feedback loops
    * Enhanced collaboration among team members
* Types of Tests **instead of going into detail about each one, link to the appropriate practice and talk about when in the pipeline these types of tests should be run. Ex, you may not want to run all of these tests for every single type of build.
    * [Unit tests](/practices/implement-unit-tests.md)
    * [Integration tests](/practices/implement-integration-tests.md)
    * [End-to-end tests](/practices/implement-end-to-end-tests.md)
    * [Performance tests](/practices/implement-performance-tests.md)
* Best Practices for Running Tests in CI Pipeline
    * Prioritize fast-running tests
    * Parallelize test execution
    * Maintain a clean test environment
        * Containerization to ensure correct dependencies
        * Database Management
    * Mock external dependencies
    * Ensure test data consistency
    * Regularly review and update tests
* Challenges and Solutions
    * Flaky tests and how to handle them
    * Managing long-running tests
    * Ensuring test coverage and avoiding test duplication
    * Scaling tests with the project growth
