# Reduce Coupling Between Abstractions

Reduce Coupling Between Abstractions means designing software in a way that its parts work independently and don't rely too much on each other.
This involves hiding the complex details inside each part, so changes in one part don't affect others. It encourages creating small, focused modules that talk to each other through simple and clear interfaces.
This makes the system easier to understand, fix, and expand, resulting in software that's more reliable and flexible.
