# Always Ask What You Could Do Differently

A popular tech mantra is, "fail fast." However, failure is only useful if you learn from it and apply that learning. Introspection is a crucial aspect of this process, as you'll miss 100% of the lessons failure provides if you aren't looking for them. Ego gets in the way of introspection. If you attribute something external to a failure, a handful of valuable lessons will pass you by. There is ALWAYS something you could've done differently. It's useful to consider how your decision making contributed to an outcome, even if it isn't a root cause.
