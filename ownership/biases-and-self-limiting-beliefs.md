# Identify and Challenge Your Biases and Self-Limiting Beliefs

Thanks to evolution, humans are wired to unconsciously short-cut critical thinking in a variety of ways. It is important to be aware of those short-cuts as they affect decision making, sometimes negatively.

A practical example of this for developers would be the anchoring bias. When estimating, if someone reveals their estimate before others have formulated and revealed theirs, it is likely the subsequent estimates will be near the initial estimate. This doesn't happen because any individuals are lazy. It's because the anchoring bias is wired into our brains. Armed with an awareness of this bias can create systems that avoid these sort of situations (like planning poker).
