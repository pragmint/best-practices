# Commit to Always Learning

While there are some skills and concepts that rarely change, members of the industry are constantly inventing new ways to leverage technology to solve humanity's problems. As a software professional, it is critical that you continually invest time in learning. The same is true for learning about your domain. The more you understand the domain of the problem you're solving, the better you'll be able to build a system fit for purpose.

Opportunities to learn are all around you. If you keep an open mind, you'll find more of those opportunities. If you seek to understand before you seek to be understood, you'll not only strengthen your relationships with your peers, but you'll learn more from them as well.
