# Meaningfully Introspect

A popular tech mantra is, "fail fast." However, failure is only useful if you learn from it and apply that learning. Introspection is a crucial aspect of this process, as you'll miss 100% of the lessons failure provides if you aren't looking for them. Ego gets in the way of introspection. If you attribute something external to a failure, a handful of valuable lessons will pass you by. There is ALWAYS something you could've done differently. It's useful to consider how your decision making contributed to an outcome, even if it isn't a root cause. Experience is a great teacher. However it gives the test first, and the lesson second.

### Identify and Challenge Your Biases and Self-Limiting Beliefs

Thanks to evolution, humans are wired to unconsciously short-cut critical thinking in a variety of ways. It is important to be aware of those short-cuts as they affect decision making, sometimes negatively.

A practical example of this for developers would be the anchoring bias. When estimating, if someone reveals their estimate before others have formulated and revealed theirs, it is likely the subsequent estimates will be near the initial estimate. This doesn't happen because any individuals are lazy. It's because the anchoring bias is wired into our brains. Armed with an awareness of this bias can create systems that avoid these sort of situations (like planning poker).

### Commit to Always Learning

While there are some skills and concepts that rarely change, members of the industry are constantly inventing new ways to leverage technology to solve humanity's problems. As a software professional, it is critical that you continually invest time in learning. The same is true for learning about your domain. The more you understand the domain of the problem you're solving, the better you'll be able to build a system fit for purpose.

Opportunities to learn are all around you. If you keep an open mind, you'll find more of those opportunities. If you seek to understand before you seek to be understood, you'll not only strengthen your relationships with your peers, but you'll learn more from them as well.
